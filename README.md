This project aims to adress both food wastage and food security, which we often found in the same communities, by creating a solution that tackles both problems simultaneously, we plan to connect surplus food suppliers, such as local restarunts,hotels and other food producers for individuals and families im need. By establishing a connection with the suppliers, we'll collect food that will be consumable and have nutritional values.
